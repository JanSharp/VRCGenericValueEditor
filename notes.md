- [ ] potentially a drop down widget
- [x] visible option for all widgets, to allow toggling without having to redraw
- [x] interactable option for all widgets
  - [ ] non interactable widgets should be darkened, not red (Would require manually changing the color of boxes and text and I'm not interested right now)
- [ ] step value for sliders, which also enables int sliders
- [ ] range limitations on integer and decimal field widgets
- [ ] custom widgets
- [x] manager which also keeps widget instances pooled for 5 minutes
